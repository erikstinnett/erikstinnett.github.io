Margin units:

    px — I don't want a thing to change size. Best used on things like borders.
    em — I want this thing to be sized relative to it's immediate parent. Best for inline icons and other stuff like that.
    rem — I want this to be relative to the root font size. Best for general text, layout... You're going to use this one a lot.
    % — I want this to be relative to the layout. You can use this for fonts if you're clever but mostly it's just for layout.
    vh, vw, vmin, vmax, dvh, svh, dvw, svh — I wan this to be relative to the size of the screen (viewport). Mostly used for layout but you can use it for other stuff if you're clever.

    When to use margin: Whenever you want to space a thing out and you don't want that space to include the border or background.

    When to use padding: Whenever you want to space a thing out and you do want to include the border and background.
